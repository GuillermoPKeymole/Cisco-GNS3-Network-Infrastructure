# Cisco GNS3 Network Infrastructure ‚Äì Enterprise Project

This repository showcases a complete enterprise network design and implementation project.It includes **Cisco IOS**, **GNS3**, and open-source systems such as **AlmaLinux** and **Ubuntu**.

## üåê Project Overview

This GNS3-based project simulates a real-world enterprise network connecting **Montreal** and **Toronto** sites. It demonstrates complete routing, VLAN segmentation, VPN, VoIP, NAT, DHCP, and DNS services across multiple devices and technologies.

### üß† Core Features:
- VLAN segmentation (IT, HR, Sales, VoIP)
- Inter-VLAN routing using Layer 3 switches
- IPsec VPN between Montreal and Toronto
- NAT and secure SSH remote access
- DHCP, DNS, HTTP, SSH services on Linux VMs
- Cisco CME voice network with IP Phones
- ACL-based access control
- Full network and service validation using CLI tests

## üíæ Base Images and VMs (For Educational Use Only)

These files are required to run the GNS3 project. Due to size limitations, they are not included directly in the GitHub repository. Store them externally or compress and link them via your portfolio.

| Filename | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `vios-adventerprisek9-m.vmdk.SPA.157-3.M3` | Cisco IOSv image for routers |
| `vios_l2-adventerprisek9-m.ssa.high_iron_20190423.qcow2` | Cisco IOSv-L2 image for switches |
| `c7200-adventerprisek9-mz.124-24.T5.image` | Cisco 7200 series image (for CME) |
| `c7200-adventerprisek9-mz.124-24.T5.image.md5sum` | MD5 checksum file for integrity validation |
| `Linux.GUI.qcow2` | Ubuntu desktop-based GUI client |
| `IOSv_startup_config.img` | Startup configuration for Cisco IOSv devices |
| `AlmaLinux-9-GenericCloud-9.2-20230513.x86_64.qcow2` | AlmaLinux cloud-ready image for server roles |
| `almalinux-cloud-init-data.iso` | Cloud-init ISO used to preconfigure AlmaLinux VMs |

You must manually add and associate these images within GNS3 before running the project.

## üöÄ How to Use

To use the `project.gns3` file:

1. Install **GNS3 (v2.2+)**
2. Ensure you have the required Cisco IOS images and linked QEMU VMs:
   - `IOSv` for routers (15.2)
   - `IOSv-L2` for switches
   - QEMU VMs for **AlmaLinux** and **Ubuntu**
3. Open GNS3 and import `project.gns3` manually
4. Connect your images using the same **compute IDs** (already stripped from snapshots and base images)
